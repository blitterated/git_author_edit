# Replacing Committer Name and Email on Commits

## Scenario

Have you ever made a series of commits and forgot to change git's local config for your name and email?

Here we'll take a look at how to replace commits with the wrong name and email associated with them.

## Tools

### Install uv with brew

```sh
brew install uv
```

### Install git-filter-repo with uv

```sh
uv tool install git-filter-repo
```

## Operation

### Create a directory to work in and jump into it

This directory will hold a clone of the repository and a `mailmap` file for remapping the user's name and email address.

```sh
mkdir ~/fix-emails && cd $_
```

### Create a mailmap file in the work directory

If you try to do this in the repo itself, you get the following warning:

```Aborting: Refusing to destructively overwrite repo history since
this does not look like a fresh clone.
  (you have untracked changes)
Please operate on a fresh clone instead.  If you want to proceed
anyway, use --force.
```

The syntax is gitmailmerge.

```text
Proper Name <proper@email.xx> Commit Name <commit@email.xx>
```

Or another way to look at the syntax:

```text
Name-to-change-to <email@tochange.to> Name-currently-on-commits <email@tobechang.ed>
```

Now create the mailmerge file.

```sh
cat > mailmap <<EOF
blitterated <blitterated@protonmail.com> Real Name <realn@foo.bar>
EOF
```

### Pull down a fresh clone of your repo

```sh
git clone git@github.com:blitterated/some-repo.git
```

At this point, your directory structure should look something like this:

```text
.
├── some-repo
│   ├── .gitignore
│   ├── some-script.sh
│   └── README.md
└── mailmap
```


### OPTIONAL: Back up your repo for convenience

```sh
gtar -I 'gzip -9' -cvf some_repo_yyyymmdd.tgz some_repo_dir
```


### cd into your cloned repo's directory

```sh
cd some-repo
```


### Capture current history

Use it to double check after filtering the repo.

```sh
git log --date=short --pretty=format:"%h%x09%an%x09%ad%x09%s"
```

### Run git-filter-repo

```sh
git filter-repo --force --mailmap ../mailmap | tee ../some_repo_author_fix.log
```

Alternatively, run a `uvx` one-shot:

```sh
uvx git-filter-repo --force --mailmap ../mailmap | tee ../some_repo_author_fix.log
```
